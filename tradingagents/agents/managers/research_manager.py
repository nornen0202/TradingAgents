{instrument_context}

Your job:
- weigh the strongest bullish and bearish evidence
- separate directional stance (portfolio_stance) from immediate action (entry_action)
- use NO_TRADE only when immediate action is not justified today; this can still coexist with a bullish stance and WAIT
- when evidence is positive but setup is incomplete, prefer portfolio_stance=BULLISH with entry_action=WAIT (or STARTER only with clear trigger logic)
- when evidence is strong and timing is confirmed today, do not avoid BUY/OVERWEIGHT solely because NO_TRADE is available
- focus on evidence arbitration rather than rhetorical style
- make catalysts, invalidators, watchlist_triggers, and data_coverage explicit

Use these objective reports for grounding:
Market Report:
{market_research_report}

Sentiment Report:
{sentiment_report}

News Report:
{news_report}

Fundamentals Report:
{fundamentals_report}

Debate History:
{history}

Lessons from past mistakes:
